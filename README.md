Hello, thanks for the opportunity to take the challenge!

Here are some points about what I did with the project:

- Decided to go with NextJs just as the standard now days, could also have started the project with Vite
- Chakrai-UI, free and easy to use library to cut the need of creation simple components, also provides a good way of
  customization, even tho i decided to use it "as-is", if i had more time to invest would definitely create a more
  visual appealing app
    - In a real world project, would have created the components by myself with SASS, those libraries tend to change too
      much and has some limitations on what can be customized
- SWR, just caching and revalidating data from requests instead of going with just the "fetch"
    - For this project in specific for a professional application I would go with something more robust like React-Query
      so we can have more control about the data coming from BE and also better optimization for both the requests and
      the organization of our code.
- Standard Jest/Testing-library for unit tests, created only a simple test for the HomePage as it takes time to create
  those unit tests and didn't have that much time now
- ESLint/Prettier - no words, required in every project I work on
- I like to have well segregated my components from my pages and containers but using SWR hook to fetch data it kinda
  mixes the usability of containers
- Would have put more time in tests, but in my opinion it's something that really takes time to make something good and
  I think unit tests should be an incremental thing within the project, not just create it once and never touches again

I think it covers the most important things from my side, probably forgetting about something, but hopefully we can talk
about it soon!

Thanks,
Hyorran Preigschadt
